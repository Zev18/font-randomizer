# Font Randomizer

Do you like more than one font? Well, now you don't have to choose just one! With font randomizer, you can have Visusal Studio Code select one of your favorite fonts for you.

Getting tired of the current font? With one command, you can change it to another one of your favorites!

## Features

This extension randomly selects a font from a list defined in its settings. You can freely add, edit, and delete fonts from this list by going into settings (Mac: command + , Windows: ctrl + ,) and searching for "random font list."

If there are no valid fonts in the list, it will select the default monospace font.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `fontRandomizer.fontList`: The array of fonts that the extension selects from.
- `fontRandomizer.activateOnStartup`: This determines if the extension changes the font every time you start up vs code or not (default: true)
